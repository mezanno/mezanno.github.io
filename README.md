**Mezanno:** *Collaborative and Assisted Annotation of Public Textual Resources Published with the IIIF API*

Welcome to the public website for the [Mezanno project](https://mezanno.xyz).

Our goal is to facilitate the collaborative annotation of textual resources published with the [IIIF API](https://iiif.io/), primarily through enhancements to the [Mirador viewer](https://projectmirador.org/).

This project is a collaboration between the [National Library of France (BnF)](https://www.bnf.fr/), the [EPITA Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.epita.fr/), the [French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN)](https://www.ign.fr/), and the [School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/).

The project will run from Fall 2024 to Summer 2026 and is currently in its early stages.

*More content will be published soon. Thank you for your patience.*
