This is the public website for the [mezanno.xyz](https://mezanno.xyz) project.

It aims at facilitating the collective annotations of textual resources published with the [IIIF API](https://iiif.io/), mainly by extending the [Mirador viewer](https://projectmirador.org/).

This is a common project between the [National French Library (BnF)](https://www.bnf.fr/), the [EPITA graduate school of computer science](https://www.epita.fr/), the [French National Mapping agency (IGN)](https://www.ign.fr/), and the [French school of advances studies in social sciences (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/).

The project will be active from Fall 2024 to Summer 2026. It is currently starting.
